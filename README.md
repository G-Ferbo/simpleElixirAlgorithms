# simple Elixir Algorithms

Usage: `elixir algo_test.exs`

These are very simple algorithms implemented in Elixir as a learning exercise. They can be tested with the algo_test.exs script. The original challenges for these algortihms came from some bootcamps onboarding and were ment to be done in Ruby.

Each has a short documentation the can be read in iex as follows
`iex(1)> h Utils.reverse_a_string


This is a gift to the public domain

The algorithms are:
1. reverse_a_string
2. factorial
3. longest_word
4. sum_nums
5. time_conversion
6. count_vowels
7. palindrome?
8. nearby_az
9. two_sub_zero
10. power_of_two
11. third_greatest
